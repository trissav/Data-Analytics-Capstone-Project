## Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing advertising trends within the political sphere, specifically examining ad spend, impressions, targeting strategies, and the relationship between ad investments and election results. The goal is to provide insights to Google on how they can enhance their advertising solutions, particularly by promoting more effective targeting and improving ad performance analytics. By understanding how political advertisers deploy their budgets and target demographics, Google can refine its advertising products to offer better solutions across industries.

## Key Insights and Recommendations:
* Ad Spend vs. Impressions: The analysis reveals that while some parties, such as CDU, spent heavily, their impressions did not always reflect this ad spend, suggesting inefficiencies in their targeting or ad strategies.
* RFM Analysis: The Steady Groups, those with consistent presence and ad spend, performed the best in terms of electoral success. These groups exhibited better engagement and sustained visibility over time.
* Recommendations for Google: Google should enhance its ad targeting tools and promote the use of advanced analytics and optimization strategies. It should also help political campaigns maintain a consistent presence and develop strategies to improve ad-to-impression efficiency.
